## b2b-company-leads

- email-oriented company prospecting

Typical outputs:

- result title
- result URL

## Common Rules

- Prefer one primary recommendation.
- Add one alternative only when it covers a meaningfully different geography, directory source, or enrichment need.
- Do not widen to the full lead-generation category until the shortlist clearly fails.
- If an upstream template provides a website URL, prefer `Contact Details Scraper` as the default enrichment choice before exploring weaker alternatives.
